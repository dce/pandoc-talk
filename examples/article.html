<p>When Minor League Baseball begins its 2021 season, there will be 25% fewer teams than there were at this time last year.</p><p><strong>The state of play: </strong>The realignment removes a net of 40 teams from 2020, for a total of 120 teams across 39 states.</p><ul><li>43 teams lost MLB affiliation. Two were Double-A clubs, while the other 41 were Single-A or lower.</li><li>Three independent teams — the Somerset Patriots, St. Paul Saints and Sugar Land Skeeters — gained MLB affiliation.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>The reshaping of the minors is a push toward modernizing MLB&#x27;s development pipeline, but the changes will leave pockets of the country without access to high level baseball.</p><p><strong>What they&#x27;re saying:</strong> In a <a class=\"gtm-content-click\" data-vars-link-text=\"letter sent to Congress\" data-vars-click-url=\"https://wbng.com/2019/11/20/major-league-baseball-responds/\" data-vars-event-category=\"story\" data-vars-sub-category=\"story\" data-vars-item=\"in_content_link\" href=\"https://wbng.com/2019/11/20/major-league-baseball-responds/\" target=\"_blank\">letter sent to Congress</a> in 2019, MLB cited poor facilities, geographic inefficiency, and &quot;too many players&quot; as key challenges within the minor league system.
